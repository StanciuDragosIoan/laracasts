/*
    all routes of a laravel project are stored in routes/web.php

    here we can define routes for our views

    a route can return either a view or a string e.g.
        return 'test_string'; //laravel will prepare that as a response and return it

        it can also return an array, say we return an array e.g. 
            return [
                "key_1" => "test"
            ];

    when a request is being made to an endpoint, a view is returned (views are stored in 
    resources/views) and the view renders the html of the page requested
